## Stop Handing Over Your Financial DNA

Every finance app wants your transaction history. They store it on their servers, analyze your habits, build profiles, sell insights. You get a pretty dashboard. They get everything else.

**Sanchay flips the script.**

Your transactions. Your patterns. Your money story. All of it stays on your machine. No accounts. No uploads. No "anonymous" data collection. Just you and your finances.

## What You Get

| | |
|---|---|
| **Instant Clarity** | See every subscription, every expense, every income stream — organized automatically |
| **AI-Powered Categorization** | Smart enough to know the difference between grocery runs and restaurant splurges |
| **Zero Data Leakage** | Nothing leaves your computer. Ever. We literally can't see your data. |
| **Works Everywhere** | Any bank. Any country. Any currency. If you got a notification, we can track it. |

Traditional Finance Apps          Sanchay
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Your data on their servers   →    Your data on YOUR device
Monthly fees                 →    Free forever
"Trust us"                   →    Verify yourself (open source)
Works when online            →    Works offline
Account required             →    No account. No signup. Nothing.
```

## Get Started in 60 Seconds

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DataOtto/sanchayapp.git
cd sanchayapp
npm install
npm run electron:dev
```

That's it. No API keys to configure. No accounts to create. No terms to accept.

---

## For Those Who Want More

**Optional AI Enhancement**

Add your own OpenAI API key in Settings for smarter categorization. The AI runs locally through your key — we never see it, never store it on any server, never even know you're using it.

**Build for Production**

```bash
npm run electron:build
```

Creates native apps for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## Tech Under the Hood

- **Desktop**: Electron 40
- **UI**: Next.js 16 + React 19 + Tailwind CSS 4
- **Database**: SQLite — fast, local, battle-tested
- **AI**: OpenAI (optional, your key)
- **Charts**: Recharts

## The Privacy Promise

| We Do | We Don't |
|-------|----------|
| Store everything locally | Have servers |
| Let you delete anytime | Create accounts |
| Open source everything | Track anything |
| Work completely offline | Phone home |

**Your financial data is yours. Period.**
